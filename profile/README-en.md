Welcome to Wakamiti
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Wakamiti** is a test automation tool inspired by Cucumber, which allows you to define tests using natural language with
Gherkin grammar. Unlike Cucumber, Wakamiti binds steps to reusable code provided by external plugins, making it convenient
for testing systems through standardized protocols such as REST web services or JDBC connections. It is fully localizable,
easily extensible with custom plugins, and can be executed as a JUnit test suite, a Maven verify goal, or a console command.
